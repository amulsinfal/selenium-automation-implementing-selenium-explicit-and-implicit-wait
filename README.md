## ‚è≥ Selenium Automation - Implementing Waiting Strategy in Automation Framework

In UI test automation, one of the biggest challenges is dealing with dynamic web elements ‚Äî they don't always load instantly, and using Thread.sleep() often leads to slow and flaky tests.
To make my framework faster and more reliable, I implemented a waiting strategy using both implicit waits and a reusable explicit wait utility class (WaitUtil). 

This approach made:  
- Cleaner code  
- Faster execution  
- Fewer false failures

### Why a Waiting Strategy Is Crucial:  
1. Handles dynamic page loads and AJAX calls  
2. Reduces flaky test failures  
3. Makes scripts faster and more efficient than Thread.sleep()  
4. Enables smart, condition-based synchronization  
5. Essential for stable CI execution

### What I Implemented:  

1. Implicit Wait (Global Level)
- Set once during driver initialization:  
  - Automatically waits for seconds specified in the properties file for elements to appear

2. Reusable Wait Utility Method  (WaitUtil.java)

3. Using Explicit Wait:
- Use the explicit wait method for elements  
  - Best for dynamic elements, modals, loaders, and AJAX

### Steps To Run:
1. Create and Clone the project to selenium-automation-implementing-selenium-explicit-and-implicit-wait folder
```
git clone https://github.com/amulsinfal/selenium-automation-implementing-selenium-explicit-and-implicit-wait.git
```
2. Go to the folder selenium-automation-implementing-selenium-explicit-and-implicit-wait containing the testng.xml file.
```
cd selenium-automation-implementing-selenium-explicit-and-implicit-wait
```
3. Open command prompt from this location and Run maven command in command prompt.
```
 mvn test
```
